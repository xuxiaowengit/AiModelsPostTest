Title: Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies,,,Markdown Content:,,Powering The,Hydrogen Age,,Founded in 2003, Horizon embarked on a global mission to create a safe, clean and sustainable future for humanity.,Our technology, products, and applications, have evolved over a 20 year journey to create the,world's most powerful,zero emission fuel cells,,turning vision to reality every step of the way.,,,,,Welcome to our story.,,Message from our Chairman,,,,,,Our mission is to replace hydrocarbon fuels with an end to end zero carbon energy solution, seeking out the highest possible global impact in the nearest possible time frame.,,Pragmatic and commercially-driven, Horizon embarked on a near impossible challenge 20 years ago. Through the years, the company went from strength to strength, from humble beginnings to building up a world leading technology, product, and manufacturing platform.,,,,,Now we're making it happen: trains, ships, planes, trucks, busses and power plants - all are starting to transition to Horizon's hydrogen-electric technologies.,,,,,Our world-class team and eco-system partners are at the forefront of transforming the world as we know it, watch this space!,,,,,George Gu - Chairman of the Board,,##### ,Powering hydrogen trucks,,##### at scale since 2018,,,Since 2015, Horizon invested heavily in the development of fuel cells for hydrogen electric mobility as there was a growing consensus that hydrogen would be a very important part of future decarbonization efforts around the world.,,,,,Since 2018, the VL Series automotive stacks have been powering trucks and buses in China, ranging from midsized buses and light delivery trucks right up to 35t and 42t prime movers.,,COMING SOON,,Horizon has made progressively higher powered fuel cell modules as the years passed by, and is now a major producer of both air cooled and liquid cooled fuel cells.,,The Gen-3 automotive fuel cells from Horizon were best in class on release, with power density above 4.9kW/L.,,,,,The soon to be released fuel cells from Horizon include an ultralight version with  ,a record power density of 6kW/L.,,,,,,World Record 500hp Fuel Cell Stack,(370kW),,The most powerful single module PEM fuel cell in the world.,,H2 POWER PLANTS,,Megawatts of clean fuel cell power on a modular basis, using,industrial hydrogen,,by-product,streams otherwise wasted.,,The potential for hydrogen propulsion in the national rail system in South Korea is being validated using,Horizon's 400kW modules,,H2 TRAINS,,H2 VEHICLE FLEETS,,,,,,End to End,Manufacturing at Scale,,Enabling our transition to a Hydrogen Economy,,Over the course of the past 20 years, Horizon has set up a globally unique end to end production capability in-house, ranging from catalysts to membrane electrode assemblies, to bipolar plate designs and fuel cell stack and system assemblies.,,,,,In 2019, Horizon installed over 20MW of fuel cell systems in commercial vehicles, leveraging flexible manufacturing systems that enabled the company to deploy anything from small air cooled fuel cells of a few watts up to single fuel cell modules of 150kW.,,,,,,##### 2008: zero emission,solutions for industry,,As Horizon continued to scale up the size of its fuel cells, it also scaled up access to hydrogen whether as a packaged gas container (e.g. BOC / Linde Genie cylinders), or using on-demand, on-site production such reformer systems for back-up power applications. In 2008, Horizon ventured with one of the world's leading hydrogen suppliers to begin replacing diesel generators for industrial lighting,, construction sites and off-grid repair activities.,,,##### 2010: hydrogen power as a service,,,Back in 2010, Horizon was the first to launch small large scale construction site lighting and engineering equipment. It partnered with BOC Gases (Linde Group) to build a new hydrogen fuel cell as a service business to start the first commercial-scale deployments of fuel cells in the UK.,,,,,,,,##### 2009: hydrogen,is in the air,,,,Following several successful test flights starting in 2006 with a NASA-backed research team in California, and in 2007 with Deutsche Luft and Raumfhart (DLR), Horizon incubated a first laboratory in Singapore dedicated to zero emissions aerial mobility research.,,,,,,,,,,,,##### Preparing the next,hydrogen,generation,,If you experimented with educational fuel cells as a student, chances are - we made them.,,,,,Early in our journey, we productised our fuel cell,experiments into a whole range of fun renewable energy technology discovery kits for schools.,,We have since formed a deep connection,with,a whole new generation of engineers that have a fond memory of their Horizon kits.,,,,,,##### Do you remember,your first,fuel cell?,,,,,,,,Several million units of small fuel cells were since commercialized across 65 countries. This early activity,has spun-off as an independent company that has developed high quality educational content and school competitions.,,,,Come change the world with us,,,HORIZON, KOREA,,583-1, Horizon Fuel Cell Korea Building, Sinkyungri, Hongseong Gun, Chungnam Province, S.Korea,,Tel: (+82) 070-8742-3433  ,Cell: (+82) 010-2663-3433,,,[Mail: daniel@horizonfuelcell.co.kr](mailto:daniel@horizonfuelcell.co.kr),,,,,HORIZON JAPAN,,2077-11 Moroi, Fukuroi-city,,,Shizuoka-ken, 437-1121 Japan,,Tel: +81-538-23-1266,,,[Mail: info@horizonfuelcell.co.jp](mailto:info@horizonfuelcell.co.jp),,,,,HORIZON THAILAND,,78 Mookda Building, Floor 3, North Sathorn Road, Silom, Bangruk, Bangkok,,Tel: +662-632-2898, +662-632-2899,,Fax: +662-632-2899 ext.111,,,,,HORIZON MALAYSIA,,25B Jln SS4D, Tmn People's Park Barneveld Ave 47300 Petaling Jaya Selangor Malaysia,,Tel: +60 166611145,,HORIZON INDIA,,415, B-Wing, Greenfield, Wagdara,,,Nagpur-441110 (MS),,Tel: +91 8830 989 135,,,,,HORIZON EUROPE,,Narodni 416/37,,,  ,110 00 Prague, Czech Republic  ,Tel: +420 222 530 490  ,Mail:,[europe@horizonfuelcell.com](mailto:europe@horizonfuelcell.com?subject=Request%20for%20Information),,,,,HORIZON U.K.,,24 Ashwin St London E8 3DL,,Tel: +44 207 503 1386,,,,,HORIZON ITALY,,Via Campo Cioso 76  ,20069 Vaprio d'Adda (Milano), ITALIA  ,Tel: (+39) 02.90.98.98.83,,[Mail: marco@horizonfuelcell.com](mailto:marco@horizonfuelcell.com),,HORIZON NETHERLANDS,,Terborgsteeg 4, 9751 BN  ,Haren (GN),Netherlands,,Tel:, (+31) 622.916.996,,Mail: [rene@horizonfuelcell.com](mailto:rene@horizonfuelcell.com),,HORIZON SPAIN,,Artekale, 16 Bajo  ,48460 Ordu,a (Bizkaia), ESPANA  ,Tel: (+34) 945 383746,,[Mail: begona@horizonfuelcell.com](mailto:begona@horizonfuelcell.com),,,,,HORIZON AUSTRALIA,,PO Box 5106,,Greenwich NSW 2065,,Tel: 61 422 469 226,,,,,HORIZON BRAZIL,,4Av.
