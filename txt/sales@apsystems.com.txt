Our product line includes microinverters, energy storage, and rapid shutdown devices, all designed to help you get the most out of your solar investment. Our microinverters are intelligent, innovative, and the best-selling multi-module microinverters in the world, providing reliable and efficient power conversion for your solar panels.,,Founded in Silicon Valley in 2010, APsystems has grown to encompass four global business units serving customers in over 100 countries. With millions of units sold, we have produced more than 4TWh of clean, renewable energy, making us a trusted leader in the ever-growing solar MLPE segment.,,*   #### Powerful,    ,    Shifting environmental factors constantly challenge the efficiency of solar arrays; dust, debris and shade can drastically lower power output. With a conventional ,string, inverter system, the least-performing module determines the productivity of the entire array , so the shadow of a single leaf will compromise the whole system.,    ,    **APsystems microinverters give you more power, independently optimizing the output from each solar module.**,If one module is shaded, all the other modules in your array will still operate at full power. Built into each APsystems microinverter is a function called Maximum Power Point Tracking. Working at hundreds of times per second, the APsystems microinverter continually finds the greatest possible module power, greatly increasing overall system performance.,    ,    APsystems microinverter installations are typically 5-15 percent more efficient than comparable ,string, systems. That,s like having more solar modules on your roof with the same-sized array.,    ,*   #### Smart,    ,    The APsystems microinverter solution combines highly efficient solar harvesting and power conversion with our high-tech data collection and communication program , giving you real-time performance and efficiency about your solar array. The APsystems Energy Communication Unit, or ECU collects module performance data and sends it to an internet database.,    ,    **The APsystems Energy Monitoring and Analysis, or EMA software allows around-the-clock management of your solar array through any web-enabled device, like your home computer or smartphone.**,    ,*   #### Cost Effective,    ,    The APsystems microinverter is the affordable, flexible solution for your solar power array. The compact, independent design allows easy installation on virtually any available surface, and because it is an integrated system, the,APsystems microinverter solution simplifies system design. Solar arrays can be easily expanded at any time, hassle-free.,    ,    Additionally, the APsystems microinverter solution gives solar installers a competitive advantage and, when fully utilized, enables installers to install faster and generate more profit than competing systems of the same capacity.,    ,*   #### Safe,    ,    Unlike central inverters with high DC voltages in the hundreds of volts, APsystems microinverters tie directly to the low-voltage PV module and connect to the public power grid via standard AC voltages , enhancing worker and homeowner safety, and eliminating the possibility of high-voltage DC ,arc, fires.,    ,,*   #### Reliable,    ,    You want an integrated system that works well together. The APsystems solar solution combines highly efficient power inversion with state-of-the-art data collection and monitoring so you,ll know precisely how your system is functioning at all times. No matter where you are.,    ,*   #### Warranteed,    ,    All APsystems products undergo rigorous factory testing, evaluation, and field tracking, guaranteeing you the highest quality, most dependable microinverters for your solar array. APsystems microinverters are designed for the same lifespan as the solar module.,    ,    **As the industry leader in solar microinverter technology, APsystems will always be here to stand behind our products., APsystems offers microinverter warranties from 10 up to 25 years.**,    ,,###### GLOBAL LEADER IN SOLAR SOLUTIONS,,### Powering the globe.

The standard 25-year warranty gives our clients to provide peace of mind.,,,,,We are always looking for cutting-edge technology in order to offer the best solutions. Our technology partners in the U.S. like APsystems always provide us with the best quality products.,,,,,This is the most northern grid-tied solar energy system in the Americas and with such a remote installation, we needed a 3-phase inverter that o,ered the best combination of performance, reliability and price. The APSystems inverter was clearly the best choice.,,,,,APsystems offers the most advanced microinverters on the market today, so adding them to our product offerings is a natural. Our installers and end customers will be impressed by the power and reliability the APsystems solution brings to their solar systems.,,,,,APsystems has the perfect mix of reliability, price and service as a vendor. Our installers love the ease and speed of installation, and not having to worry about messy and expensive cables.,Our goal is to make APsystems the No. 1 microinverter in Canada.,,,,,Working with APsystems signi,cantly improved the net pro,t on the installation due to a decrease in labour time compared to string inverters. Winning this project was highly competitive, and knowing our install times with APsystems was very valuable in ensuring our bid was as accurate as possible while protecting our margins.,,,,,We are choosing APsystems as our microinverter because they are second to none in their functionality, efficiency and durability. Their production specifications are becoming the benchmark of what a microinverter should be able to do and produce.,,,,,With APsystems and our third-party financing, we are taking an important step towards simplifying and lowering costs of PV system ownership for residential customers.,,,,,APsystems Microinverters are much easier to install than the other ,major, company,s inverters. There is no expensive trunk line to stock, as the AC lines are attached to inverters. Also, there is one inverter per two modules, so only half the inverters to install and ground., With one inverter per two modules, it allows for an easy install for various layouts.,,,,,APsystems is leading the industry in solar microinverter innovations. Its revolutionary approach of individualized, maximized microinverters paired with its quality products and ease of installation is what separates it from the crowd.,,,,,APsystems microinverters made this project successful because of their easy installation.
