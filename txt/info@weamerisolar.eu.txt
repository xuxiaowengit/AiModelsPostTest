Polycrystalline (sometimes also called multicrystalline) solar panels are the most common because they are often the least expensive. They are the middle choice in the marketplace, almost as good as single cell monocrystalline silicon panels but generally with a better efficiency than thin film solar panels.,,,### Monocrystalline solar panels,,,We manufacture monocrystalline solar panels with 60 cells and 72 cells 6, and with 72 cells 5,. Monocrystalline photovoltaic electric solar energy panels have been the go-to choice for many years. They are among the oldest, most efficient and most dependable ways to produce electricity from the sun.,,### Half Cell Solar Panels,,Half-cell solar panels have a high increasing demand in the PV market because of their high performance and durability. Half-cell solar panel is manufactured by halving the silicon solar cells precisely in a symmetrical way using a laser cutter then, stringing the cells through inserting conductive thin lines called busbars to connect the halved cells.,,,### Bifacial Solar Panels,,,Bifacial solar panels are one of the new advanced technologies in the PV sector. The concept behind the bifacial solar panels is that the PV modules receive the incident solar rays on the front side as well as on the rear side of the panel to generate electricity. Therefore, the bifacial solar panels can exploit much more solar irradiance than the mono facial modules resulting in more power output.,,### On-grid Solar System,,Amerisolar On-grid Solar System, its solar panel kits, are designed to provide a complete energy solution for residential and commercial roofs. The PV system is composed of solar modules, inverters, mounting systems and other necessary accessories. All the components are from the top-class manufacturers, and ensure the highest energy yield and maximize your return on investment.,,,### PV Solar panels for Desert Area,,,The Amerisolar PV Solar panels for desert area are a particular type of solar panels made for specific area of the planet such as desert or savanna where climatic conditions are very hard. Our solar panels have successfully passed the most important test report , Blowing sand modules and cable , and in this way we have obtained the TUV Nord and the TUV Rheinland certifications.,,### Check the Amerisolar Catalogs,,,Solar Panel installation around the world,-----------------------------------------,,,##### 65MW in Brazil,,,##### 50MW in Hungary,,,##### 49.5MW in India,,,##### 40MW in Canada,,,##### 25MW in Denmark,,TESTIMONIALS,------------,,**Maurizio Verna** Belgium,,*   ,*   ,*   ,*   ,*   ,,It was my first time ordering directly from China.
