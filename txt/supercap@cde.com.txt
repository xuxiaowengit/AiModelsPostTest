Title: Cornell Dubilier | Filter Capacitor,,,Markdown Content:,    ,    ###### **Released Mar, 2024**,    ,    ,    **_Three-cell devices offer greater energy potential and power output than single or dual-cell parts in standard PCB layouts_**,    ,    **_3-cell DSF & DGH capacitors provide very fast power discharge that cannot be matched by conventional capacitors or batteries. That large capacity makes it possible to support brief power interruptions, supplement batteries, or even be used in place of batteries in many applications._**,    ,    ,    ###### **Released Nov, 2023**,    ,    ,    **_Type MXT Series Metallized Polypropylene Film Capacitor, designed to suppress conducted electromagnetic/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) at a circuit,s power input. These capacitors are perfect for use in harsh environments having met the demanding 85/85 THB (Temperature, Humidity, Bias) test requirements. Class X2 capacitors, like the MXT, are typically connected across the AC input to prevent interference from spreading through power lines or other devices on the same circuit._**,    ,    ,    ###### **Released Sep, 2023**,    ,    ,    **_Type MYH series of Y2, EMI/RFI suppression capacitors are designed for harsh environments. The MYH series is AEC-Q200 qualified, meets a 2,000-hour THB (Temperature, Humidity, Bias) life test, and has applications in motors, AMR (Automated Meter Readers), UPS, power supplies, charging systems, and appliances. These Y2, line-to-ground capacitors filter out electromagnetic noise and have multiple international safety agency approvals._**,
