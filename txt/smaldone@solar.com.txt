As a matter of fact, our installed system was huge and there were modifications that had to be made. They stuck by their original labor quote even though they could have hit us up for extra time and materials. This isn't my first experience with having solar installed but by far the best!",,### John B.,,### Los Angeles, California,,,"We had been wanting to "go solar" for a number of years, but were turned off by sales people from various solar companies who were pushy or just not crediblet about their system vs others.
